    "# **Machine Learning-Based Detection of Simulated Malware in FPGA Bitstreams**\n",
    "### *Copyright (c) 2025, Rye Stahle-Smith* \n",
    "---\n",
    "#### ***Description:***\n",
    "This project explores the application of machine learning techniques to detect malicious modifications in FPGA bitstreams, specifically targeting the *PYNQ-Z1 FPGA Development Board* by Xilinx and Digilent. Rather than relying on custom-generated data, the project now leverages state-of-the-art (SOTA) benchmarks from **Trust-Hub**, a resource sponsored by the **National Science Foundation (NSF)**. Although these benchmarks have not been updated since 2013, they represent realistic chip-level attack scenarios. The original designs were re-engineered and adapted to work with the PYNQ-Z1 platform. As of the latest update, the dataset consists of ***one-hundred and twenty-two samples*** — ***twenty-five benign AES-128, twenty-one benign RS232, twenty-five benign AES-128, twenty-one benign RS232, and thirty empty bitstreams***.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ***Objectives:***\n",
    "**Objective 1: Integrate and adapt industry-standard benchmarks for modern FPGA platforms.** <br>\n",
    "Task 1.1: Reconfigure Trust-Hub HDL benchmarks to compile and synthesize successfully using Xilinx Vivado for compatibility with PYNQ-Z1. <br>\n",
    "Task 1.2: Synthesize and implement modules on the PYNQ-Z1 board to verify functional correctness and hardware compatibility. <br>\n",
    "Task 1.3: Organize, label, and curate the bitstream dataset across multiple classes (benign, malicious, empty) for use in supervised learning. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective 2: Design an ML-based detection pipeline for hardware Trojans in FPGA bitstreams.** <br>\n",
    "Task 2.1: Convert raw .bit files into sparse byte-frequency representations and apply dimensionality reduction using Truncated Singular Value Decomposition (TSVD). <br>\n",
    "Task 2.2: Apply SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to balance class distributions in the training set and mitigate bias. <br>\n",
    "Task 2.3: Train and compare multiple classifiers (Random Forest, Decision Tree, SVM, Gradient Boosting, etc.) using k-fold cross-validation to identify the most effective model. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective 3: Evaluate model performance and ensure robustness across Trojan variants.** <br>\n",
    "Task 3.1: Analyze performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and class-wise true/false positive rates. <br>\n",
    "Task 3.2: Generate confusion matrices and perform error analysis to assess model weaknesses and edge cases. <br>\n",
    "Task 3.3: Assess model robustness by deploying the trained model on the PYNQ-Z1 platform to validate real-time prediction performance and resource efficiency in a target embedded environment. <br>\n",
