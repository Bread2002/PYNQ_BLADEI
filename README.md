# **BLADEI: Bitstream-Level Abnormality Detection for Embedded Inference**
### *Copyright (c) 2025, Rye Stahle-Smith* 

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository contains an embedded deployment pipeline for detecting **malicious FPGA bitstreams** using a trained machine learning (ML) model. Bitstreams are configuration files that can be weaponized to introduce hardware Trojans, posing serious risks in shared or cloud-hosted reconfigurable systems. This project leverages a lightweight, byte-level classification approach and enables **on-device malware detection** for **PYNQ-supported FPGA boards**, without requiring reverse engineering techniques or access to original source code or netlists. Benchmark designs, including AES-128 and RS232 variants, were obtained from Trust-Hub, then synthesized, implemented, and categorized as benign, malicious, or empty `.bit` files

---

## ⚙️ Features

- 🔍 **Byte-frequency analysis** of binary `.bit` files
- 🧩 Lightweight **byte-level + statistical** feature extraction
- 📊 Real-time inference using a trained **Random Forest** with a custom, dependency-light predictor
- ⚡ Deployment-ready for **ARMv7 (e.g., PYNQ-Z1/Z2, Zynq-7000 SoC)** and **ARMv8 (e.g., Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC, RFSoC, Kria) boards**
- 🧪 Verified with state-of-the-art (SOTA) bitstreams derived from **Trust-Hub** benchmarks

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

This project is divided into two parts:

- 🧠 **Model Training and Export**
- ⚙️ **On-Device Inference**

---

### 🧠 `train_model.py` — Model Training and Export

> **Requirements:**
> - Python 3.8+
> - Python Packages: `scikit-learn`, `numpy`, `scipy`

> ⚠️ **Note:**
> Training should be performed on a general-purpose machine (laptop, workstation, or server) for **both ARMv7 and ARMv8** targets. While some ARMv8 boards *may* be capable of training, it is not the intended workflow here—training is heavier, package availability can be inconsistent, and it’s typically slower and less reproducible than running on a PC.  

1. Clone the Repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Bread2002/PYNQ_BLADEI.git
   cd PYNQ_BLADEI
   ```
   
2. Install Dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Training Script:
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

#### ***Features:***
- Byte-frequency feature extraction from `.bit` files (256-dimensional normalized histogram)
- Statistical augmentation features (e.g., mean, std, skew, kurtosis, entropy, density metrics)
- Training and evaluation using k-Fold Cross-Validation
- Best-performing model exported as compact artifacts (JSON + NumPy arrays) and bundled into a `.tar.gz` archive for PYNQ deployment

---

### ⚙️ `deploy_model.py` — On-Device Inference

> **Requirements:**
> - A supported FPGA board with PYNQ v3.1
> - Quantized model components (via on-board training or exported archive)

1. Import the Archive to your PYNQ board via Jupyter Notebook or SSH/SFTP

2. Decompress the Archive:
    ```bash
    mkdir PYNQ_BLADEI
    tar -xvzf PYNQ_BLADEI.tar.gz -C ./PYNQ_BLADEI
    rm PYNQ_BLADEI.tar.gz
    cd PYNQ_BLADEI
    ```

3. Run the Deployment Script:
   ```bash
   python deploy_model.py
   ```

#### Features:
- Loads `.bit` files from local storage  
- Extracts byte-frequency + statistical features
- Predicts class (`Benign`, `Malicious`, or `Empty`) using the trained model
- Displays prediction result with latency breakdown:
  - Load time  
  - Feature extraction time  
  - Inference time
- Quarantines suspicious bitstreams
